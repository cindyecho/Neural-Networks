# Neural-Networks
**Apply deep learning to do time series forecasting using Keras and Tensorflow**

The objective of this project is to apply deep learning to a time series forecasting problem.  The dataset used for this project are weather conditions recorded at the Weather Station at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.  The original data collection dates to 2003 with weather conditions logged every 10 minutes.  However, for the purpose of this project, the data was reduced to hourly data for the years 2009 to 2016 (inclusive).  Four Neural Network models will be created differing in architecture and hyperparameters.  This project was a part of a Kaggle competition.
